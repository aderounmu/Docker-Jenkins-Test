# Docker-Jenkins-Test1


This project uses CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The pipeline is managed using Jenkins and Docker, with the following steps:

- Test: Automated tests are run against the newly-built image to ensure that it meets the expected criteria.
- Build: The Docker image is built using the Dockerfile in the root directory of the project.
- Push: The image is pushed to the Docker registry to make it available for deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this pipeline, you will need the following tools installed:

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to:

- Copy code
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```
- Set up a Jenkins pipeline using the Jenkinsfile in the root directory of the project.
    - You may need to configure Jenkins to use Docker and other plugins needed for the pipeline.
    - You will also need to configure your Docker registry credentials to allow Jenkins to push the built image.
- Once the pipeline is set up, any changes pushed to the repository will automatically trigger the pipeline to build, test, and deploy the changes.

## Notes

- The Dockerfile in the root directory of the project contains the instructions for building the Docker image used in the pipeline.
- The Jenkinsfile in the root directory of the project contains the instructions for the pipeline steps.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to use CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deployment process. With Jenkins and Docker, you can streamline your development workflow and improve your team's productivity. If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know.
